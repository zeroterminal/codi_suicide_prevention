                            Talking about suicide: expressing the thoughts of wanting to die or hopelessness.<br>
                            Getting the means to take your own life: such as buying a gun or stockpiling pills.<br>
                            Having mood swings: extreme shifts in moods from being happy to being sad in a short period of time or vice-versa.<br>
                            Isolation: stops attending social events or social gatherings with family and friends.<br>
                            Increasing substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, etc...).<br>
                            Loss of interest: loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities or hobbies.<br>

                            Attempted suicide before.<br>
                            Feeling hopeless, worthless, or socially isolated. <br>

                            Having suicidal thoughts and having access to firearms in your home.<br>
                            Having an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>
                            Having a family history of mental disorders, suicide, or violence, including physical or sexual abuse.<br>
                            Having a medical condition that can be linked to depression and suicidal thinking, such as chronic disease or terminal illness.<br>

                            Suicide prevention methods and treatment are based on patient risk factors. Such as:<br>
                            Speaking Up: whether the individual has suicidal thoughts, or you spot the warning signs in someone else, you must speak up. Although trust is important, keeping a person’s planned method of suicide a secret can put their life at risk.<br>
                            Psychotherapy or talk therapy; most common:<br>
                            Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: individuals are taught new ways of dealing with stress and stressful life experiences instead of directing to take their own life. <br>
                            Dialectical Behavior Therapy: individuals are taught to recognize disruptive or unhealthy feelings or actions.<br>
                            Increased education and awareness among medical professionals might decrease suicide rates in the future: in some cases, warning signs were dismissed by the medical professionals leading the individuals to suicide or attempt suicide.<br>
                            Medications: some medications used in the treatment of mental disorders include an increased risk of suicide as a side effect; medications are still controversial.<br>
