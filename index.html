                        Warning Signs help the visitors recognize potential and early signs in themselves or others and encourage early intervention, for example:
                        1.	Talking about suicide: expressing the thoughts of wanting to die or hopelessness.
                        2.	Getting the means to take your own life: such as buying a gun or stockpiling pills.
                        3.	Having mood swings: extreme shifts in moods from being happy to being sad in a short period of time or vice-versa.
                        4.	Isolation: stops attending social events or social gatherings with family and friends.
                        5.	Increasing substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, etc...).
                        6.	Loss of interest: loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities or hobbies.
                        7.	Changing daily routine: such as eating or sleeping patterns.

                            Risk Factors:
                        </h2>

                        Risk factors, which may be individual or environmental, can increase the likelihood of suicidal behavior. For example:
                        1.	Attempted suicide before.
                        2.	Feeling hopeless, worthless, or socially isolated. 
                        3.	Experiencing a stressful life event, such as the loss of a loved one, a breakup, or financial or legal problems.
                        4.	Having suicidal thoughts and having access to firearms in your home.
                        5.	Having an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.
                        6.	Having a family history of mental disorders, suicide, or violence, including physical or sexual abuse.
                        7.	Having a medical condition that can be linked to depression and suicidal thinking, such as chronic disease or terminal illness.

                            Suicide Prevention Methods:
                        </h2>

                        Suicide prevention methods and treatment are based on patient risk factors. Such as:
                        1.	Speaking Up: whether the individual has suicidal thoughts, or you spot the warning signs in someone else, you must speak up. Although trust is important, keeping a person’s planned method of suicide a secret can put their life at risk.
                        2.	Psychotherapy or talk therapy; most common:
                        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: individuals are taught new ways of dealing with stress and stressful life experiences instead of directing to take their own life. 
                        Dialectical Behavior Therapy: individuals are taught to recognize disruptive or unhealthy feelings or actions.
                        3.	Increased education and awareness among medical professionals might decrease suicide rates in the future: in some cases, warning signs were dismissed by the medical professionals leading the individuals to suicide or attempt suicide.
                        4.	Medications: some medications used in the treatment of mental disorders include an increased risk of suicide as a side effect; medications are still controversial.
